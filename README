Fast and compact routines for time series storage in C for use
with other software / language.

Unix
----

    Requirements:

    - GNU C compiler (gcc)
    - GNU make

    Compilation instructions:

    ./configure
    make

    Among others, this will create a .libs subdirectory with the
    compiled library. You may then run "sudo make install" to install
    it system-wide, or, preferably, set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    environment variable to include the .libs subdirectory in the
    library search path. The second way is preferred, because
    at the time of this writing dickinson changes too fast to trust a
    system wide install. If you are running bash, you need to use

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd`/.libs

    but you need to remember to type this every time you run a shell.
    Instead of that, what I actually do is prefix each command that
    needs it; for example, to run a Django development server:

    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../dickinson/.libs ./manage.py runserver

    This has the added benefit that it does not get confused if I have
    many instances of openmeteo on my system.

Windows
-------

    Requirements:

    - Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Express

    Installation instructions:

    - Start MS Visual C++
    - Choose File, Open, Project/Solution
    - Select the file Dickinson.vcxproj
    - Right-click on the Dickinson project and select Build
    - If it asks you, tell it where to save the "solution" file (we don't store
      it, let it recreate it each time).
    - When it finishes, copy Debug\Dickinson.dll somewhere where it can be
      found, such as C:\Windows\System32.
